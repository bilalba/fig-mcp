# TODO - Fig MCP Server

## Priority
- [x] Server error: `TypeError: Do not know how to serialize a BigInt` (fixed: added `jsonReplacer` in server.ts)
- [x] Shadows not implemented
- [ ] Refactor render out of the experimental folder.
- [ ] Gradient backgrounds don’t render
- [ ] Color blur doesn’t render
- [ ] Letter spacing is wrong or not parsed
- [ ] Zoom is too sensitive and laggy

## Other Issues
- [ ] SVG loading is too heavy; explore alternatives

## Parsing & Layout Intelligence
- [ ] Component/instance tracking
- [ ] Investigate tree traversability and navigation patterns
- [ ] Infer responsive breakpoints from frame variants

## Pipeline Exploration
- [ ] Explore intermediate formats for agent-to-code workflows
